## Listening Quiz 1
* This Thursday
* 5 listening examples (twice each; ~60 seconds); includes writing a paragraph of info about one of those. All the examples are on the Medieval music on Naxos. 
* Paragraph of info: information about genre, imformation about time period in music, information about composer, and information about specific work. 
Mistakes and extra information on Naxos:
1. "Gracias" (it is *gratias*)
2. *Gaude Maria Virgo* is not by Leonin; it is by a student of Perotin
3. the motet is not by Adam de le Halle; he wrote one of the texts. 
4. There is extra information on Naxos on *Ordo Virtum: In Principio*; Naxos calls that the "Finale," which it is, but that is not necessary to get credit for the title. 
Clarifying the notes
* "burden: the refrain": specific vocabularly for the genre of the carol; in the English carol, sometimes there is a refrain, they call it the burden. 
* Order of medieval sacred genres
	* Gregorian chant → organum → 13th cent. motet → (mass cycle)
* How much info do we have on Cantiga de Santa Maria--Pilgrimage song (played while walking/on pilgrimage), does use percussion and instruments, from a Spanish collection by Alfonso X (who may be the composer, but he also may have stolen other people's stuff for this collection)
## Renaissance (sacred): 1450-1600
This time distinction does not necessarily line up with visual art. In music, the Renaissance is not as important as in visual art. 
The most famous composer os Josquin des Prez. 
This time period is a beginning to musical ideas that will fully develop in the next period (like opera), and also the end to other ideas that were mostly outworked in the Middle Ages. 
Important factors: growing middle class; printing; development of instrumental music / further notation; the Reformation. 
The book doesn't do a great job of covering the Reformation--the book looks for new genres/progression, and the Reformation looks like a regression without understanding the theology. 
### Music of the pre-Reformation Renaissance (1450-1510/1520)
What does music sound like leading into the lifetime of Luther? :
* Structure of worship: the Mass (p. 100)
* on average, if you're an urban / well-populated / rich area, you will hear more musical variety, you can pay more musicians to write music, have more musicians on church staff; pilgrimage provides new music. 
* If you're in a rural or less-populared or poor area, you're going to hear Gregorian chant much more often
* Default music: Gregorian chant; even in richer churches, at least half the mass is still done in Gregorian chant
* richer area/bigger area: still maintaining [organum](2023-01-24#12th century developments in music at Notre Dame de Paris), [13th cent. motets](2023-01-24#Motets) (polytexted), and mass cycles
#### Mass cycle
Originated by Gullaume de Mauchaut (1300-1370) . 
A set of all the movements of the Ordinary of the Mass (Kyrie, Credo, Sanctus, Gloria, Agnus Dei) in a matched group that is sung the same way every day/every mass.
Arranged polyphonically. 
But there is an addition/change to the Proper--every mass has an Introit, a Communion, a Gradual, and an Offertory, but the text is changeable. 
#### Cantus Firmus Mass
(sort of mass cycle)
A new invention for the Renaissance. 
Unified the movements by using a tune in all of them in one or more voice parts. 
#### Example: Missa Puer Natus est Nobis
Missa L'Homme Arme: Title of secular song whose title was used. 
Most popular of the cantus firmus--L'Homme Arme (the Armed Man); (previous classes used a different composer's mass)
Title: Missa L'Homme Arme: Kyrie
Composer: Antoine Busnois
Genre: cantus Firmus mass
century: 15th-16th
But it does make it hard to hear the text. 
#### Latin motet
1400s invention. 
The definition is different than [it was in the 13th cent.](2023-01-24#Motets). The Renaissance motet is a polyphonic used with sacred poetic text for a portion of the Proper (in Latin). 
#### Example: Vene Sancte Spiritus
composer: Josquin des Pres
genre: motet (Latin motet)
century: 15th-16th.
Josquin des Pres is Luther's favorite composer. He moves around where the money is, moving from Northern France to the Pope eventually. 
### Music of the Reformation
The Reformation was not monoligic. The goal of the Reformation was to fix the Catholic church, in terms of doctrine or practice. 
#### Luther on Music
Luther loves music and thinks that it is second only to Scripture to move the human heart; he thinks beauty is really important. 
Main complaints about church music:
1. Hard to understand the text
2. Music is in Latin (music should be in vernacular)
3. Music is not congregational enough (he wants to have as much congregational music as possible)
4. He doesn't like drunken singers and inappropriate texts. 
Luther writes a mass himself (including music) in German (he keeps a little Latin for pedagogical usage). The Deutsche Messe is mostly Gregorian chant (although in German)...simple text for everyone to hear/participate in. 
Luther encourages the composition of hymns (doctrine-based texts sung to new melodies or pre-existing song tunes for everyone's participation)--some are in 3-4 parts. 
#### Calvin on Music
Regulative principle: what in Scripture is the best example of this concept and how can we apply that?
Thus, exclusive psalmody, in vernacular, on a single melody, with the congregation. Calvin has a congregant write a psalter--one melody per psalm, for singing in worship. 
#### Anglican course of action
They don't have much time to figure things out. They translate the Mass. Mass = service. Motet = Anthem. Everything is sung in English. 
#### Zwingli on music
Because he is a musician, he decides that music should be banned from worship so that the participants can focus on the Words. 
### Music of the Counter-Reformation 
(Romish Response--1560-1580)
Counter-Reformation = Council of Trent: 18 years long. 
In year 17 (1562), the Council issues a statement on music: 1 paragraph that sounds like it was written by a committee. Thus, it is a very general statement including "music should be executed clearly and at the right speed" and should avoid "lascivious singing and organ playing."
Application for most composers:
* Stops performance of inappropriate texts in mass (final goodbye to 13th cent. motets)
* Some composers interpret this to mean that all vocal parts should line up for specific syllables (all parts sing the same words at the same time)
#### Pope Marcellus Mass
title: Pope Marcellus Mass: Gloria
genre: Mass / Gloria
century: 16th--1567
Really famous in music history because Palestrina is trying to change the RCC's music style.
