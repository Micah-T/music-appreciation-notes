## Listening Quiz 1
* This Thursday
* 5 listening examples (twice each; ~60 seconds); includes writing a paragraph of info about one of those. All the examples are on the Medieval music on Naxos. 
* Paragraph of info: information about genre, imformation about time period in music, information about composer, and information about specific work. 
Mistakes and extra information on Naxos:
1. "Gracias" (it is *gratias*)
2. *Gaude Maria Virgo* is not by Leonin; it is by a student of Perotin
3. the motet is not by Adam de le Halle; he wrote one of the texts. 
4. There is extra information on Naxos on *Ordo Virtum: In Principio*; Naxos calls that the "Finale," which it is, but that is not necessary to get credit for the title. 
Clarifying the notes
* "burden: the refrain": specific vocabularly for the genre of the carol; in the English carol, sometimes there is a refrain, they call it the burden. 
* Order of medieval sacred genres
	* Gregorian chant → organum → 13th cent. motet → (mass cycle)
* How much info do we have on Cantiga de Santa Maria--Pilgrimage song (played while walking/on pilgrimage), does use percussion and instruments, from a Spanish collection by Alfonso X (who may be the composer, but he also may have stolen other people's stuff for this collection)
## Renaissance: 1450-1600
This time distinction does not necessarily line up with visual art. In music, the Renaissance is not as important as in visual art. 
The most famous composer os Josquin des Prez. 
This time period is a beginning to musical ideas that will fully develop in the next period (like opera), and also the end to other ideas that were mostly outworked in the Middle Ages. 
Important factors: growing middle class; printing; development of instrumental music / further notation; the Reformation. 
The book doesn't do a great job of covering the Reformation--the book looks for new genres/progression
