### About Hildegard von Bingen
* [Hildegard was canonized 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen)
* an abbess
* visionary (mystic)
	* she wrote down the music she hard in her visions
* she wrote books, including *Scivias*, about her visions
* she taught herself how to read and write
	* perhaps this is why she writes music in an unconventional manner
		* her music has an extended range (typical Gregorian chant is restricted to an octave)
		* she also uses big jumps expressively
### Alleluias
* The cantor says *alleluia*
* the choir says *alleluia* and adds a *jubilus* (an extra *a*)
* the piece is named by the incipit (the beginning)
## Uses for music in monasteries and convents. 
1. Mass
2. Office (of readings): The primary task of monks was to pray. The office was readings & prayers at specified intervals over the day, which sometimes were set to music. Matins and Vespers are two of these intervals. 
3. sacred music drama (also known as liturgical drama, though it was not part of the mass): drama on Scripture or related story, usually in a church building *or* outside.
* Hildegard is the only author to write text, music, and also to sign her name:
## Ordo Virtutum: In Principio
Play of the Virtues: In the Beginning
* (confusingly, the last part of the play)
* Genere: music drama/liturgical drama
* century: 12th
* main character: Anima (soul/spirit)
* secondary characters: the virtues, Satan (a speaking-only role; the only role played by a man and so had to be played the priest)
## 12th century developments in music at Notre Dame de Paris
* first written sacred polyphony
* Leonin, Perotin (his student), and a group of students/composers called the "Notre Dame School"
* They worked on how to beautify music, without instruments and with the limited notation system available. 
* ### Genre: Organum
	1. Predating Leonin: improvised parallel melody in 4ths or 5ths[^2]
	2. Florid organum: invented by Leonin; Gregorian chant slowed almost to a drone with another melody on top singing the same text.
	3. Discant: invented by Perotin: drone with multiple upper parts sung note-against-note. 
	4. Rhythmic modes: invented by Perotin: rhythmic patterns repeated throughout
	All of this was compiled into the *Magnus Liber Organi* (big book of organum)
## Gaude, Maria, Virgo
Rejoice, Mary, o virgin
* composer: a student of Perotin (anonymous--Naxos is wrong)
* genre: Organum (leading into Gregorian chant)
* century: genre 12th; this work 13th (it is a late example)
## Motets
Monks were bored sometimes, because not all really wanted to be monks, so they did weird stuff. 
* Motets were a 13th development in French music in which words (French *Mot*) are added in the form of new songs & texts on top of pre-existing Gregorian chant (sing as a drone). 
* Piling sacred text/poetry (newly composed, in Latin or in French) on top of secular text/poetry/pre-existing songs (in French) on top of slowed-down Gregorian chant (in Latin)
* These were sung in church
	* note that the common people would hear the French most likely
## Mout Me Fu Grief / Robin M'aime / Portare
Greatly I am Grieved / Robin Loves Me / To Carry

## Cantigas de Santia Maria, No 159

[^2]: Much to my annoyance; this is quite against the rules of music theory as we know it.
